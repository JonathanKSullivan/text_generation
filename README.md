# Artificial Intelligence Engineer Nanodegree: Deep Learning Applications
## Recurrent Neural Networks
### Time Series Prediction and Text Generation

Used Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to build RNNs that can generate sequences based on input data - with a focus on two applications: With the first I used real market data in order to predict future Apple stock prices using an RNN model. The second one is trained on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel Sherlock Holmes and will generate wacky sentences based on it that may - or may not - become the next great Sherlock Holmes novel!
